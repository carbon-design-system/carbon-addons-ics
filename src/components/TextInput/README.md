### About

Text fields enable the user to interact with and input data. A single line field field is used when the input anticipated by the user is a single line of text as opposed to a paragraph.

The default type is 'text' and its value can be either 'string' or 'number'.

Notice there is no placeholder prop. The label is designed to be the placeholder.
